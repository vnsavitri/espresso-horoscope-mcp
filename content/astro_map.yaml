      Your shot flows like the morning sun - bright and quick, but lacking the deep warmth of midday. 
      At {brew_ratio:.2f}:1 ratio in just {shot_end_s:.0f} seconds, your espresso seeks more time to develop its full character. 
      The cosmos whispers: slow down, let the magic unfold. Grind finer, extend the journey, 
      and watch as your coffee transforms from a fleeting glimpse into a profound experience.
