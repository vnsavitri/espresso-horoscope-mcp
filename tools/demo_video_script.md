## üéØ Demo Flow (5-7 minutes)

### 1. **Opening Hook (30 seconds)**
**Script:**
> "What if your morning espresso could tell your fortune? Today I'm showing you Espresso Horoscope - an AI-powered system that combines real espresso shot data with astrology to create unique, personalized coffee readings. Built for the OpenAI Open Model Hackathon, this project runs completely offline and uses GPT-OSS for dynamic content generation."

**Visual:**
- Show the beautiful purple gradient interface
- Highlight the tagline: "Discover your cosmic coffee destiny"

### 2. **Core Concept Demo (2 minutes)**
**Script:**
> "Let me show you how it works. I'll enter my sister's birthday - October 7th, which is 1007 in MMDD format."

**Actions:**
- Enter `1007` in the birth date field
- Click "Generate my espresso horoscope"
- Wait for card to appear

**Script (while loading):**
> "The system is analyzing a real espresso shot from our database of 98 different shot variants, each with authentic pressure curves, flow rates, and extraction data."

**When card appears:**
> "Look at this! We get a 'Ristretto ‚Ä¢ Dense Constellation' - notice how the title shows both the actual coffee shot type and a cosmic theme. The system determined this was a ristretto based on the 1.8:1 brew ratio. The reading is completely unique and poetic, not a template."

**Highlight:**
- Coffee shot type in title
- Zodiac sign (Libra) with icon
- Dynamic style (e.g., "afternoon-flow")
- Unique poetic reading
- Shot metrics (ratio, time, pressure, temperature)

### 3. **Variety & Personalization (1.5 minutes)**
**Script:**
> "Let me show you how different birth dates create different experiences."

**Actions:**
- Enter `0611` (June 11th)
- Show new card appears

**Script:**
> "Now we get a Gemini reading with a completely different shot type - this time it's an 'Americano ‚Ä¢ Steady Supernova'. Same system, different cosmic personality."

**Actions:**
- Enter `0101` (January 1st)
- Show another variation

**Script:**
> "And here's a Capricorn with a 'Lungo ‚Ä¢ Gentle Cosmos'. Each reading is unique because the system combines the shot characteristics, your zodiac sign, the time of day, and AI-generated content."

### 4. **Technical Deep Dive (1.5 minutes)**
**Script:**
> "Let me show you the technical magic behind this. The system uses real espresso shot data with 98 different variants including ristretto, lungo, americano, and double shots."

**Actions:**
- Open terminal
- Show backend running: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`
- Show API response with shot data

**Script:**
> "The backend uses FastAPI and processes each shot through our diagnostic rules. We have 50+ curated style categories and GPT-OSS integration for dynamic content generation."

**Actions:**
- Show API call: `curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate_cards?mmdd=1007"`
- Highlight the JSON response structure

**Script:**
> "Everything runs offline - no external API calls required. The GPT-OSS integration provides fallback systems, so even without AI, you get beautiful, varied readings."

### 5. **Real-World Application (1 minute)**
**Script:**
> "This isn't just a fun demo - it's built for real espresso enthusiasts. Users with Gaggiuino machines can connect their actual shot data. The system tracks your coffee journey over time, showing how your brewing skills improve."

**Actions:**
- Show multiple cards for same user (if available)
- Highlight historical tracking

**Script:**
> "Each shot gets a unique reading based on its actual characteristics. Fast shots get 'early-pulse' styles, slow shots get 'lunar-flow' vibes. It's educational and entertaining."

### 6. **Closing & Impact (30 seconds)**
**Script:**
> "Espresso Horoscope combines real coffee science with creative AI to make espresso brewing more engaging and educational. It's built with modern web technologies, runs completely offline, and demonstrates the power of GPT-OSS for dynamic content generation. Perfect for the OpenAI Open Model Hackathon!"
